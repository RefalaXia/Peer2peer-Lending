### Description
Peer to peer lending focuses on investors being able to directly contribute a portion of the principal on loans to individuals. The Lendingclub allows these investors back loans from $1,000 to $40,000. Investors make money by getting their contribution paid back with varying levels of interest. The loans are rated at different grades from A1 to G5, with A1 being the best.

### Question
How can we achieve a competitive advantage for our client Dr. D when he's investing in lendingclub.com?
